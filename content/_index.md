description: I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics at the CUNY Graduate Center and a junior scholar at the [Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality](https://stonecenter.gc.cuny.edu/people/desai-aman/).
  My primary research fields are labor economics and applied microeconometrics. 
  In my job market paper, I incorporate dynamic complementarity into the measurement of income inequality of opportunity using supervised machine learning.
  Additionally, I employ causal inference and machine learning techniques to examine inequality in educational and health opportunities, 
  focusing on the roles of families, markets, and government. Feel free to reach out at [adesai@gradcenter.cuny.edu](mailto:adesai@gradcenter.cuny.edu)
