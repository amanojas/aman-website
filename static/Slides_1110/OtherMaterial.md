## Opinion Writing 


Here are the [links](\Slides_1110\Articles_Spring2022.docx) to the articles for your opinion writing exercise. You are expected to write your opinions on two topics. I have assigned two articles on each topic with two opposite views. Knowing both sides of the issue will help you think critically and form better arguments. You must form your opinion based on economic arguments as the purpose of this exercise is to use the tools we learned in this course and apply them while thinking about real world issues.\


Following are the questions you should be addressing in your opinion writing.

- What is the author saying? 

-  What are their reasons or arguments?

-  Do you agree or disagree with their arguments? (This is where you want to use your knowledge from the class)

- Is there anything you want to add to their arguments or criticize their arguments? (Again, think about what we learned in the course)
