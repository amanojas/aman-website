## Abstract 

We analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on undergraduatesâ€™  performance in an introductory economics course at
a large public university.  One challenge in analyzing student academic outcomes during the pandemic was the explicit
change in grading policies by college administrators as well as the implicit adjustment by faculty designed to mitigate
the impact of an abrupt shift to online learning amidst the stress and uncertainly associated with the pandemic. To limit
the impact of grading policies we analyze changes in the  raw scores on a common final administered to all sections of the
course the year before and for four semesters after the spring of 2020.  To limit variation in the difficulty of the exams
from before to during the pandemic, we compare student performance on nearly identical questions on the final  exam overtime.
Adjusted mean scores on the common final fell by 0.6 points  and the probability of answering the qualitatively same question
on the final fell, on average, by 5.7 percentage points. Students with lower GPAs were 3.3 percentage points less likely to
answer similar questions correctly relative to students with higher GPAs during the pandemic. The mean probability of answering
a nearly identical question before and after suddenly moving to online classes increased by 5.6 percentage points.
