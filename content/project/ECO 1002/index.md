excerpt: The primary focus of macroeconomics is the study of aggregate economic variables,
  e.g. interest rates, income, inequality, unemployment, and the price level. In this course,
  I discuss why and how the government attempts to control these variables using fiscal and monetary policy,
  as well learning the theory underlying these policies. I also discuss issues such as national income accounting, 
  growth and the variety of competing macroeconomic theories. Students are expected to have taken the usual high school mathematics courses,
  which involve algebra and elementary analytic geometry.
